The simulation replication challenge is an interdisciplinary collaborative attempt to replicate influential simulation studies that investigate the performance of statistical methods. 

A single statistical simulation study can guide hundreds of applied researchers in the analysis of their research data. Despite often being conceptionalized akin to mathematical proofs, simulation studies are computer experiments that are vulnarable to human error just like any other empirical research. 

We hence set out to attempt the replication of influential simulation studies. In the process we hope to learn whether the information presented in the manuscript is sufficient to guide us, whether we obtain the same results and how many replicator degrees of freedom we encountered along the way.
