# Code of Conduct

Be kind! (everything else is details)

This code of conduct outlines the expectations for participants of the simulation study replication challenge. 
We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community as well as a save learning environment for all and expect
our code of conduct to be honored. 


In our collaboration we strive to:  


* **Be friendly and patient.**

* **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and
  supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not
  limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour,
  immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual
  orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status,
  political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

* **Be considerate**: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
  will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users
  and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when
  making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might
  not be communicating in someone else's primary language.

* **Be respectful**: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
  no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
  frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
  personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people
  feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

* **Be careful in the words that we choose**: We are a community of
  professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do
  not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary
  behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to: Violent
  threats or language directed against another person, Discriminatory jokes and
  language, Posting sexually explicit or violent material,  Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms,
  Unwelcome sexual attention, Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above
  behavior, Repeated harassment of others.
  However, be awareare that you might be communicating with someone who's first language is not English. 
  They might have accidentally used a wrong word or the wording they have used 
  has a different connotation in their native language.

* **Try to understand why we disagree**: Disagreements, both social and
  technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements
  and differing views constructively. We see diversity of backgrounds and talents as a strength.
 Being unable to understand why someone holds a
  viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to
  err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping
  to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
  
* **We are all here to make Research Better!**: It is not our goal to criticize the specific work we are replicating but improve the field as a whole.. 
	Please  appreciate their effort and give them the benefit of the doubt. A lot of decisions in the publication process are not made by the authors.
