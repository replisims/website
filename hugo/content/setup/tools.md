Use of the following collaboration tools is encouraged.
You are free as a pair to decide on different tools. 
However, everyone can benefit from active use of the same tools to learn from each other. 

## {{< awesome fab fa-gitter >}} Gitter
Gitter can be used as a platform to discuss details pertaining to your project.
Each pair will have one room for their replication.
There is also a community room for the entire team.

## {{< awesome fab fa-git-alt >}} Git 
While you could just use github as a mere cloud storage for your code it is most powerful if used in combination with git.

## {{< awesome fab fa-github >}} Github issues
Github issues are an easy way to alert your partner of a particular issue. 
You can ask for help and assign tasks. This is also an easy way to involve a consultant by tagging them.

## {{< awesome fas fa-check >}} Pull requests
Best practice is a branch based workflow. 
Whenever you have finished a chunk of the replication you create a merge request and ask your partner for a code review.
The reviewed commit can then be merged to the master branch.

## {{< awesome fab fa-docker >}} Docker
To ensure the same computational environment for both partners (and potentially an consultant)
and avoid problems with R versions, package versions and operating systems it might be useful to run the code in a docker container.
Web based alternatives might be binder, code ocean or R studio cloud.
