## Out of scope
- Criticising the author's approach
- Improving the method
- Writing the project paper

## But...
- You can add a critical comment to your verification report
- You can implement a second improved method in the code
- You can volunteer to help writing the project paper (and of course get to approve it before it is submitted)
