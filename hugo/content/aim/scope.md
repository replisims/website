We aim for this project to be a great learning experience and a chance for international and interdisciplinary collaboration with like-minded researchers.

Depending on your time, current skill-level and enthusiasm and the different complexities of a given project  there is a broad spectrum of what you might be able to contribute.

## Replication

## Out of scope
- Criticising the author's approach
- Improving the method
- Writing the project paper

## But...
- You can add a critical comment to your verification report
- You can implement a second improved method in the code
- You can volunteer to help writing the project paper (and of course get to approve it before it is submitted)
