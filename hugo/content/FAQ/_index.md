## Do I have to work in R?
No, using R is not mandatory. However, two aspects have to be kept in mind when choosing a different software solution.
(1) You will have to find someone that is familiar with the language you would like to use. 
(2) The idea of replicability being closely related to open science calls for an implementation that itself is openly accessible i.e. an open source tool (see also our [replication principles](/aim)).
 
## Does the replication have to be implemented in the same software environment as the original?
No. In theory the study results should not depend on the software environment used for the implementation. We strive for a replication that is openly accessible and reproducible i.e. implemented with open source tools [replication principles](/aim)).
It can, however, be necessary to familiarize oneself with the software originally used to gain a better understanding of the internals of the algorithms that were likely used.

## Can I replicate a simulation study that is not on the list?
Yes, absolutely. We do, however, recommend that you consult a peer, supervisor (or us) regarding feasibility.
Likewise, if you lack experience with any of the methods covered by the suggested replication candidates, we can help you locate a more suitable simulation study investigating a method you feel more comfortable with.

## When is the deadline?
The individual replications have no hard deadlines. 
However, we conceptualized this as a summer project. 
This has the advantage of some focused collective momentum and availability. 
A new semester usually comes with new projects and new responsibilities. 
Ideally, your replication is in a state where it can be handed over before you are buried in other work.
Since collaborators in this project come from different parts of the world with different holiday seasons and academic years we will be working on slightly different timelines.
