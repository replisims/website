### Do I have to work in R?
No, using R is not mandatory. However, two aspects have to be kept in mind when choosing a different software solution.
(1) You will have to find someone that is familiar with the language you would like to use. 
(2) The idea of replicability being closely related to open science calls for an implementation that itself is openly accessible i.e. an open source tool (see also our [replication principles](/aim/#replication-principles)).
 
### Does the replication have to be implemented in the same software environment as the original?
No. In theory the study results should not depend on the software environment used for the implementation. We strive for a replication that is openly accessible and reproducible i.e. implemented with open source tools [replication principles](/aim/#replication-principles)).
It can, however, be necessary to familiarize oneself with the software originally used to gain a better understanding of the internals of the algorithms that were likely used.

### Can I replicate a simulation study that is not on the list?
Yes, absolutely. We do, however, recommend that you consult a peer, supervisor (or us) regarding feasibility.
Likewise, if you lack experience with any of the methods covered by the suggested replication candidates, we can help you locate a more suitable simulation study investigating a method you feel more comfortable with.

### I prefer working alone, do I have to be part of a pair?
Well, not necessarily but maybe somewhat. 
As a primary replicator you can work as independently as you want to. 
However, you might get stuck or just need somebody to bounce of an idea or double check your decisions. 
That is what the co-pilot can be for. 
You could of course theoretically always ask us but your co-pilot has in depth read the study and might help you more efficiently.
If you work more efficiently alone the ideal way to go would just be to openly communicate that to a co-pilot so they know that it is nothing personal and no reason to get worried if they don't hear from you in a while.
If you can literally make it all the way through the replcation alone your co-pilot could then simply become the reviewer. 

### How do I get access to the github organization?
If you provide Anna or Kim with your github user name we can invite you to the [replisims github organization](https://github.com/replisims).
Github will then send you an email with an invitation to join. 
If you did not receive such an email it might be a good idea to check which email address is associated with your github account and/or check the spam filter.

### Should I contact the author to ask for code or in case of uncertainties.
Whether or not you contact the original study author to ask for code or additional information is up to you.
If you decide to do so, please, carefully archive the correspondence as well as all materials received. 
However, keep in mind that waiting for a reply might take a while and require several reminders/attempts in searching for current contact data. 
We hence advise that you either contact the authors right before the replication or try implementing the replication independently and contact them after your best attempt.
An exception might be if the manuscript explicitly refers to a simulation protocol or supplemental materials but these cannot be obtained (e.g. due to a broken link).
Should your replication attempt result in large deviations from the original, 
and those discrepancies remain after thorough review, 
we will contact the original author before publication.

### When is the deadline?
The individual replications have no hard deadlines. 
However, we conceptualized this as a summer project. 
This has the advantage of some focused collective momentum and availability. 
A new semester usually comes with new projects and new responsibilities. 
Ideally, your replication is in a state where it can be handed over before you are buried in other work.
Since collaborators in this project come from different parts of the world with different holiday seasons and academic years we will be working on slightly different timelines.
